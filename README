CGILua 5.1.2
http://keplerproject.org/cgilua

CGILua is a tool for creating dynamic Web pages and manipulating input data from Web forms.
CGILua allows the separation of logic and data handling from the generation of pages,
making it easy to develop web applications with Lua.

One of advantages of CGILua is its abstraction of the underlying Web server.
You can develop a CGILua application for one Web server and run it on any other Web server
that supports CGILua, even if using a different launching model.

CGILua can be used with a variety of Web servers and, for each server, with different launchers.
A launcher is responsible for the interaction of CGILua and the Web server, for example using
ISAPI on IIS or mod_lua on Apache. The reference implementation of CGILua launchers is Kepler.

CGILua is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.
